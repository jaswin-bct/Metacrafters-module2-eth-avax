# 🛠️ MetaCrafter dApp

> 💸 A Decentralized Application (dApp) for crafting unique NFTs and trading them on the blockchain.

## Description

MetaCrafter dApp is an innovative decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It empowers users to create, customize, and trade unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). With this dApp, users can unleash their creativity and craft one-of-a-kind digital assets that can be owned, bought, and sold by others in the NFT marketplace.

## Technologies Used 🌐

This cutting-edge dApp utilizes the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: Solidity, a programming language for smart contracts, is used to create the NFT contract in this project. It enables the creation of unique tokens with distinct properties.

- **Ethers.js**: Ethers.js, a JavaScript library, facilitates the interaction between the dApp and the Ethereum blockchain. It enables seamless execution of transactions and data retrieval.

- **MetaMask**: MetaMask, a popular browser extension wallet, is integrated into the dApp, allowing users to manage their Ethereum accounts and interact with the decentralized application.

- **Hardhat**: Hardhat serves as the development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides tools for compiling, deploying, and testing the NFT contract in this project.

## Contract Details 🔗

The smart contract used in this project is named `NFT` and is located inside the `contracts/NFT.sol` file. It allows users to create unique NFTs with customizable properties, and it enables the transfer of NFT ownership.

## Configuration ⚙️

The `hardhat.config.js` file is used for configuring the Hardhat development environment. It specifies the Solidity version and required libraries to deploy contracts on the Hardhat node.

## Scripts 📜

The `deploy.js` script, located in the `scripts` folder, is used to deploy the `NFT` contract. It uses Hardhat's `ethers` library to interact with the blockchain. This script is executed with the `npx hardhat run` command.
