🌐 Web3 Local Bank
💸 A Simple Web3 application for transferring Ether and personalizing your account.

Description
Web3 Local Bank is an intuitive web3 application that leverages the power of Ethereum networks to provide a decentralized banking experience. With this dApp, users can easily deploy a smart contract and perform two main functions: transferring Ether to other accounts and personalizing their account names. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and Solidity smart contracts, and it utilizes the user-friendly MetaMask wallet extension to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.


Technologies Used 🛠️
This project utilizes the following technologies:

Solidity: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It is used to write the Bank smart contract in this project.

Ethers.js: Ethers.js is a JavaScript library that provides a concise and consistent API for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-like networks. It is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute transactions in this project.

MetaMask: MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that allows users to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications. It is used to connect to the Ethereum network and perform transactions in this project.

Hardhat: Hardhat is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides tools for compiling, deploying, and testing contracts. Hardhat is used to compile and deploy the Bank smart contract in this project.

Installation ⬇️
Follow these steps to get the project up and running 🏗️
Download or clone the project.
Install the dependencies by running npm install.
Start the local blockchain using Hardhat by running npx hardhat node.
Open a new terminal and deploy the Bank contract by running npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js.
Start the development server by running npm run dev.
Configure MetaMask to use the Hardhat node 🦊
Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
Click on the account icon in the top right corner and select "Settings".
In the "Networks" tab, click on "Add Network".
Fill in the following details:
Network Name: hardhat-test-network
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
Chain ID: 31337
Currency Symbol: GO or ETH
Click on "Save" to add the Hardhat network to MetaMask.
Add accounts using private keys by Hardhat for testing 🔑
In the MetaMask extension, click on the account icon in the top right corner.
Select "Import Account" or "Import Account using Private Key" (depending on your version of MetaMask).
In the "Private Key" field, enter one of the private keys provided by Hardhat.
To access the list of private keys, open the terminal where you started the Hardhat local network.
The private keys are displayed as part of the accounts generated by Hardhat.
Click on "Import" to import the account into MetaMask.
Repeat the above steps to add more accounts for testing purposes.
If you need detailed instructions or visual guidance, you can refer to this step-by-step guide on how to use MetaMask with a Hardhat node.

Usage 🪜
To use the application, follow these instructions:

After connecting MetaMask to the Hardhat local network, connect your wallet with the application.
Click on "Transfer Funds" and fill in the recipient's address and the amount you want to transfer.
Click the "Transfer" button to initiate the transaction.
Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
The transaction details will be logged to the console, and the account balance will be updated.
You can also personalize your account name:

Enter a new name in the input field.
Click the "Update Name" button to set the new account name.
Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
The account name will be updated, and the change will be reflected in the account details.
Contract Details 🔗
The smart contract used in this project is named Bank and is present inside the contracts/Bank.sol file. It allows users to set an account name and transfer funds. The contract emits events for successful transfers and name updates.

Configuration ⚙️
The hardhat.config.js file is used for configuring the Hardhat development environment. It specifies the Solidity version and required libraries to deploy contracts on the Hardhat node.

Scripts 📜
The deploy.js script, located in the scripts folder, is used to deploy the Bank contract. It uses Hardhat's ethers library to interact with the blockchain. This script is executed with the npx hardhat run command.
